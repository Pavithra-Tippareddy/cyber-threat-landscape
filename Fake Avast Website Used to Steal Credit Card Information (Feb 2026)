### Overview

Cybercriminals are exploiting a fake website impersonating Avast to steal credit card details from unsuspecting users. The malicious
site mimics the official Avast download and purchase pages, tricking visitors into entering sensitive payment information that is then
captured by attackers.

This activity leverages brand impersonation and social engineering, drawing victims with the promise of legitimate security software
while harvesting financial credentials.

### Attack Details

The fake Avast site was promoted through search results and possibly ads, appearing credible to users seeking Avast downloads or services.

Visitors attempting to purchase or renew antivirus products were shown counterfeit payment forms.

When users submitted credit card details, the information was collected by attackers instead of being processed by legitimate payment
systems.

No indication of malware installation was observed — the focus is on credential and payment theft.

This type of attack preys on users’ trust in well-known brands and relies on convincing design and URL spoofing.

### Primary Impact

Stolen credit card numbers

Financial loss for victims

Potential abuse of payment cards in fraud schemes

Reputational damage to affected users

This scheme does not exploit a software vulnerability but rather deceives users to voluntarily enter sensitive information.

### MITRE ATT&CK Mapping (Example)
Technique	Description
T1566 – Phishing	Social engineering and deceptive websites to lure victims
T1593 – Search Engine Spoofing	Malicious search results driving traffic to fake site
T1589 – Initial Access via Web Traffic	Victims directed to fraudulent site through search/ads

Note: Although not a typical malware attack, this activity aligns with ATT&CK techniques related to phishing and brand impersonation.

### Recommendations

Verify official domains before entering personal or financial data.

Use bookmarks for trusted download sources.

Enable browser anti-phishing and HTTPS validation tools.

Consider payment methods with fraud protection (credit cards with monitoring).

Report fake sites to security services and Avast if encountered.

### Key Takeaways

Attackers are using brand impersonation to harvest credit card details.

No malware required — the attack relies on social engineering and spoofed web content.

Users and organizations should be cautious when downloading or purchasing software online.
