### Overview

Threat actors are actively targeting **Microsoft 365 accounts through an OAuth token theft campaign designed to bypass traditional authentication protections, 
including multi-factor authentication (MFA).

Instead of stealing passwords, attackers focus on obtaining valid OAuth access tokens, allowing persistent access to victim accounts without triggering standard
credential-based alerts.

### Why OAuth Token Theft Is Dangerous?
OAuth tokens:
1) Grant API-level access to cloud services.
2) Can persist beyond password resets
3) Often bypass MFA once issued
4) Allow attackers to access mail, files, and user data.
5) Because authentication has already been completed, possession of a valid token effectively grants session-level access.

### Primary Targets

1) Corporate Microsoft 365 tenants.
2) Executive accounts
3) Finance and HR departments

## Attack Methodology

Step 1 – Initial Access
Attackers use:

1) Phishing emails.
2) Consent phishing (malicious OAuth apps)
3) Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM) phishing pages
4) Victims are tricked into:
a) Logging into fake portals.
b) Granting permissions to malicious Azure applications
5) Organizations using cloud-only identity models.

### Step 2 – Token Acquisition

Once authentication succeeds:
1) OAuth access token is captured

2) Refresh token may also be stolen

3) Attacker stores tokens for persistent use

### Step 3 – Post-Exploitation

1) Attackers use stolen tokens to:
a) Access Exchange Online mailboxes
b) Exfiltrate sensitive emails
c) Create mailbox forwarding rules
d) Access SharePoint / OneDrive files
e) Conduct Business Email Compromise (BEC)
f) Because no password is used, password resets may not immediately remove access.

### Observed Techniques:

1) Creation of rogue Azure AD applications.
2) Abuse of delegated API permissions
3) Stealthy API-based data access
4) Use of legitimate Microsoft endpoints for C2-style activity.

| T1550.001 – Use of Web Session Cookie  | Session/token replay                     |
| T1528 – Steal Application Access Token | OAuth token theft                        |
| T1078 – Valid Accounts                 | Use of legitimate cloud accounts         |
| T1114 – Email Collection               | Mailbox data exfiltration                |


### Indicators of Suspicious Activity

Security teams should monitor for:

1) Unusual OAuth application consent grants.
2) New Azure enterprise application registrations.
3) Tokens issued to unfamiliar app IDs
4) Unusual IP addresses accessing Microsoft APIs
5) Suspicious mailbox forwarding rules
6) Large-scale email download activity

### Defensive Recommendations:

1) Enforce strict OAuth app approval policies.
2) Limit user consent for third-party applications.
3) Enable conditional access policies.
4) Monitor Azure AD audit logs for app registrations.
5) Implement token revocation after suspicious activity.
6) Review mailbox forwarding and inbox rules regularly.
7) Use phishing-resistant MFA (FIDO2 where possible).

### Strategic Security Impact

Token-based attacks represent a shift from credential theft to session hijacking.

Advantages for attackers:

1) MFA bypass after token issuance.
2) Stealthier access.
3) Reduced brute-force attempts.
4) Harder detection via password monitoring.
5) Cloud-first organizations are particularly exposed because authentication and data access are API-driven.

## Personal Analysis

This campaign demonstrates a broader industry trend: identity is the new perimeter.

Rather than exploiting software vulnerabilities, attackers increasingly focus on abusing authentication workflows and trust relationships within cloud ecosystems.

OAuth token theft is especially dangerous because it leverages legitimate cloud functionality, making detection reliant on behavioral analytics rather than signature-based controls.

Organizations must shift from password-centric defense models to identity and token lifecycle monitoring.

### Key Takeaways

OAuth tokens can be more valuable than passwords.

MFA does not protect against token replay once issued.

Identity monitoring is critical in cloud environments.

Consent phishing is becoming more common.

Token revocation and audit logging are essential defenses.
