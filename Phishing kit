Phishing Kit Hosted on Legitimate Cloud and CDN Platforms Targeting Microsoft and Google Users.
The most widespread and dangerous phishing campaigns today are powered by Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM) kits, which help unfold phishing attacks where threat actors become a proxy between the victim and a legitimate service.

The top three most active phishing kits remain Tycoon2FA, a Phishing-as-a-Service platform designed to bypass multi-factor authentication; 
Sneaky2FA, an AiTM threat used in Business Email Compromise attacks; and EvilProxy, a reverse-proxy phishing kit often used for account takeover attacks aimed at high-ranking executives.
ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox provides security teams with the capabilities to quickly detect phishkit attacks thanks to interactive analysis. In addition to static detection, the 
sandbox lets SOC analysts safely follow the entire attack chain in an isolated VM and go past all the evasion layers to 
reveal the final malicious credential theft page or payload.
