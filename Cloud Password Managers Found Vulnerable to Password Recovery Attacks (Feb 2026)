## Overview

A new academic study by researchers at ETH Zurich and Università della Svizzera italiana analysed several major cloud-based password managers and revealed that 
password recovery mechanisms in these platforms contain design weaknesses that can be exploited under certain conditions. These flaws challenge the 
widely-advertised “zero-knowledge encryption” security model that promises user vaults remain protected even if servers are compromised.

Study found that multiple cloud-based password managers, including Bitwarden, Dashlane, and LastPass, are susceptible to password recovery attacks under 
certain conditions.

Summary of Vulnerabilities

The identified vulnerabilities fall into four main categories:

Key Escrow / Recovery Feature Abuse
Attackers could exploit recovery workflow mechanisms to compromise confidentiality guarantees in Bitwarden and LastPass.

Flawed Encryption Implementation
Weaknesses in item-level encryption paired with unprotected metadata could lead to integrity violations, metadata leakage, and downgrade attacks.

Sharing Features Exploited
Attack vectors involving shared vaults could allow unauthorized access or modification of stored credentials.

Legacy Compatibility Issues
Support for outdated cryptographic methods enabled downgrade attacks in Bitwarden and Dashlane.

## What This Means

Although none of the vulnerabilities have been observed in the wild exploitation, the study demonstrated proof-of-concept attacks where a malicious or 
compromised server could:

Recover stored passwords

Modify vault content

Bypass assumed cryptographic protections

This shows that even widely trusted “zero-knowledge” systems may have unexpected weaknesses when certain features are enabled.

## Mitigations & Vendor Response
1) Dashlane has patched legacy cryptography support that could be abused for downgrade attacks.
2) Bitwarden confirmed that most issues are being actively remediated or resolved.
3) LastPass has stated plans to strengthen password reset and sharing workflows. 
4) 1Password acknowledges certain limitations reflect known architectural decisions and includes mitigation strategies in its public security documentation.

At the time of reporting, there was no observed exploitation in real-world attacks related to these specific findings.

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping (Example)
Technique	Description
T1557 – Adversary-in-the-Middle	Exploiting recovery workflows where attackers manipulate authentication or data flows.
T1573 – Encryption Weakness	Abusing flawed encryption or key derivation logic to expose protected data.
T1530 – Data from Cloud Storage	Compromise or unauthorized retrieval of information stored in cloud-based vaults.

## Defensive Recommendations:

1) Enforce multi-factor authentication for recovery workflows.
2) Treat cloud password managers’ server infrastructure as a high-risk attack surface.
3) Apply all vendor-recommended patches and updates promptly.
4) Review shared items and recovery settings for unnecessary exposure

## Personal Analysis:

This research highlights that password manager security is not only about strong cryptography — it’s also about secure architectural design. 
Even systems claiming zero-knowledge guarantees can be vulnerable when ancillary features (like recovery and sharing) are introduced. Users and 
enterprises should consider the security trade-offs of convenience features and adopt a defence-in-depth approach to credential protection.
