Overview

Google has released an emergency security update for its Chrome browser, addressing three high-severity security flaws that 
affect major Chrome components, including media processing, WebGPU shader compilation, and developer tools. The update was released
as version 145.0.7632.116/117 (desktop) and 145.0.7632.120 (Android). Users are strongly advised to update immediately to reduce risk.

### Vulnerabilities Patched
1)  CVE-2026-3061 – Media Component Out-of-Bounds Read

An out-of-bounds memory read in Chrome’s media code can expose sensitive memory or be used as part of a larger exploit chain.

2) CVE-2026-3062 – WebGPU Tint Out-of-Bounds Read/Write

This flaw affects Chrome’s WebGPU shader compiler “Tint.” Out-of-bounds writes may enable memory corruption, raising the
possibility of arbitrary code execution when combined with additional bugs.

3) CVE-2026-3063 – DevTools Implementation Issue

An inappropriate implementation in Chrome DevTools can introduce a privileged boundary weakness, possibly enabling data exposure
or security control bypass.

At the time of reporting, there are no confirmed active exploits in the wild for these three flaws, but delaying the update increases risk from potential future attacks.

## Impact & Risk

Chrome’s market dominance—present on billions of devices—makes it a valuable target. High-severity memory and implementation bugs
in browser engines are often leveraged to compromise systems via malicious web content, drive-by downloads, or crafted media files.

### Recommendations

Update Chrome Immediately:
Go to Help → About Google Chrome or allow automatic updates to install the latest version.

Enterprise Patch Management:
Ensure corporate devices are patched through centralized update tools and policies.

Monitor for Exploitation:
Watch for unusual behavior, crashes, or suspicious processes after update deployment.

### Key Takeaways

Three high-severity vulnerabilities were fixed, spanning media, WebGPU, and DevTools.

No active exploitation has been confirmed yet, but prompt patching is essential.

Updating across all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android) reduces exposure to browser-based attack vectors.
